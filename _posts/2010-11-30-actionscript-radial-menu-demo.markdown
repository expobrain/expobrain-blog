Today I was talking with a ex-colleague from the previous company I worked for and comes in my mind the first project I did in ActionScript some months ago.

<!-- more -->The project is a demo of a context menu around a circle which can be drag around the screen, rotated and push with a little of kinetic effect (the kinetic effect is not perfect but it's closer enough). All items can have unlimited subitems and a little tooltip. All item icns, labels, tooltips and hierarchy can be defined by an external XML file.

If you want to enjoy this demo click [here](http://www.expobrain.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/radialmenu/RadialMenuDemo.html) and thus click on any part of the page to open the menu. A single click outside the menu will close it.

If the menu is too small for your likes, just double click on it to enlarge by a factor of 2x.

Good playing :-)
