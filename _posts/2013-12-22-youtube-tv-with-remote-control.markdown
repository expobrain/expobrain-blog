[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) is the most successful and well known platform for video sharing, the available video content is huge with around 100 hours of videos uploaded on their servers every minute. Personally, I'm spending more time on the YouTube platform than watching my TV.

The YouTube platform already offers to you a good website where enjoy your preferred content but it can do more it can offer a remote controlled home-theatre interface to be enjoyed from your sofa just by your laptop and your Android device.

This feature can be accessed by your pointing your browser to [http://www.youtube.com/tv](http://www.youtube.com/tv):

YouTube TV is an easy-to-use interface to the YouTube library where you can browse an discover content in different categories. But the best part of this interface is the remote control by an Android device, just install on you smartphone the [YouTube Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ytremote) app from Google Play launch it and proceed until the step where you are asked to add a new screen:

in the YouTube TV interface open _Sign In & Settings_ and select _Pair Device_:

Pair your device by scanning the QR code or by typing the pair code generated by YouTube, name it and press the _Add Screen.._ button. You have now successfully paired your device with the instance of YouTube TV running in your browser so know you can control that instance from your smartphone. 

The application UI is a little unrefined, the look&feel doesn't integrate very well into the Android's design guides but offers to you all the basic functionalities of the YouTube home page: search videos, recommended videos, your subscriptions and your playlists.

And now the cool stuff: selecting a video on the device will play the video in the YouTube TV instance but allows you to control the video from your device including like/dislike and sharing the video with the Android's Share action;
