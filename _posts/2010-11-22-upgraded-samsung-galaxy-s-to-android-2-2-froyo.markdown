I finally upgraded my Samsung Galaxy S to Android 2.2 Froyo!

<!-- more -->The firmware upgrade process was done by the Samsung Kies application which updated itself just before warning me about the new firmware. The whole process taken about half an hour to download the firmware, copying it to the device and reboot the device.

After the looong reboot the Samsung Galaxy S was slow for another 20 minutes more ore less, but now I have some nice features available:



	
  * tethering via USB

	
  * doesn't need anymore to activate the USB Debugging option to use it with [doubleTwist](http://www.expobrain.net/2010/08/13/synchronize-your-samsung-galaxy-s-with-itunes)

	
  * Skype for Android is working (yeah 8-) )

	
  * you can enable/disable the Internet connection when connected on 2G/3G networks (bye bye [APNdroid](http://www.expobrain.net/2010/08/30/watch-out-for-the-data-traffic))

	
  * enable/disable the auto rotation of the display


..and a lot more. Those are just the first important things (for me) I saw after the upgrade.

No it's the time to try to make some application..
