[Taskcoach](http://www.taskcoach.org), a todo manager to keep track of personal tasks and todo lists, now use [wxScheduler](http://code.google.com/p/wxscheduler/) to show tasks in the Calendar view.

I'm proud to see my wxPython component used for the first time in a non-commercial project. I glad to Jérôme Laheurte to have chosen wxScheduler for his calendar view and for the patch and improvements he made to wxScheduler.

<!-- more -->From the Taskcoach website:


<blockquote>Task Coach is a simple open source todo manager to keep track of personal tasks and todo lists. It grew out of a frustration that most task managers do not provide facilities for composite tasks. Often, tasks and other things todo consist of several activities. Task Coach is designed to deal with composite tasks. In addition, it offers effort tracking, categories, and notes. Task Coach is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and iPhone and iPod Touch.</blockquote>

The latest wxScheduler source code with the code contribution from Taskcoach can be download from [here](http://code.google.com/p/wxscheduler/source/checkout) (the tar.gz package is a little old).
