The [TabbedWindow](https://github.com/expobrain/tabbedwindow-qt) project's source code is now available on [GitHub](http://github.com/). This is a implementation of the same tabs Drag&Drop behaviour that you can find in Firefox or Google Chrome browsers.

<!-- more -->

Any tab dragged outside the main window will create a new window with the dragged tab and tabs can be moved between different windows as well.

This code is a proof of concept of how that behaviour can be implemented in Qt so the code itself is not perfect nor feature rich.

However I think this is a good starting point for a more complete widget or framework.

The source code is available under the New BSD license
