How you can make your Mac speak a word or a phrase ? Simply ! Let's just tell him to say that.
<!-- more -->Open the Terminal and type


    
    say "hello, I'm a Mac"



and type Enter. Just a little but funny utility (and a useful feature if used with some fantasy).

If you want to save the output to a file use the -o options like this:


    
    say -o hello.aiff "hello, I'm a Mac"



and there the result
