Two weeks ago I bought the new Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and after a full day spent to make confidence with the Android OS one big question comes in my mind: will iTunes detect the phone and synchronize my music library ?

No :-)

<!-- more -->Obviously iTunes don't want to deal with non-Apple devices, so I started to search an alternative solution.

Some time spent on Google lands me to the [DoubleTwist](http://www.doubletwist.com) web site. DoubleTwist is an application with the same look&feel of iTunes and with, more or less, the same functionality. The goal behind DoubleTwist is to build a platform to synchronize devices from different brand through the same application.

The description was interesting, so I downloaded it and tried with my new smartphone: DoubleTwist founds all my music library and videos in iTunes and also in my home profile folders and, following the on-screen instructions to connect the Samsung Galaxy S as a storage device, I was able to synchronize the iTunes playlists over my phone.

DoubleTwist can also export your photo and your videos re-encoding them for best fit the phone display. An Android Market browser, podcast search and Amazon music store are presents too.

Ok, that application gains a place in my dock.
