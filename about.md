I'm a developer writing in Python, JavaScript and sometimes Rust and Go.

My professional experience comes from developing desktop applications in Qt, but now I'm working on web applications and Big Data.

This is my personal space where I share anything that can be useful to myself an to others; I hope that you will find, or maybe you already found, something cool and useful for you too.

You can find more code and samples on my <span class="genericon genericon-github"></span> [Github](https://github.com/expobrain) account.

Follow me on <span class="genericon genericon-twitter"></span> [Twitter](https://twitter.com/expobrain)

And of cours have a look at my <span class="genericon genericon-linkedin"></span> [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieleesposti) profile.
